This directory contains the following subdirectories:
1) design - subdirectory with design source files
2) include - subdirectory with design definitions
   The include files are separate, so you may include them in your testbench code.
3) obj - here you will put your compiled files.
4) reports - here you will store your simulation output logs.
5) testbench - subdirectory with the verification code
   You should modify audio_app.test_top.sv in this directory,
   and you can also create your own source code if you need.

make command options
1) make: compile source code for the DAR design and your testbench.
2) make run: run simulation
3) make dve: compile source code and run DVE (a GUI enviroment).
4) make clean: remove all the object files

NOTE: run first 'make', then 'make run'.
      If you want to use DVE, simply run 'make dve'.
