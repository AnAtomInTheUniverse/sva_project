Arbiter
-------
The fixed design file arbiter.v and the 
testbench which was used to detect the 
design errors test_arbiter.v are included
in this tarball. 


----------
DAR Module
----------
The only file that was modified for verifying
the DAR module was audio_app.test_top.sv. All
of the tests are contained within that file
and so are all of the assertions. No other source
files are needed. In order to execute the testbench,
first use 
		> make all 
to compile the design and the testbench, followed by
		> make run
		or
		>./simv
to run the testbench. Assertions should fire when 
they detect an error and produce a console output. 
Two assertions fail, corresponding to a design 
error in the err_ signal. Clearly, as seen in line
68 of the delay_prgrm.sv file in /DAR/design/, 
the err_ flop is assigned to err_ instead of nxt_err.
This is the bug. 

A screenshot is included in this tarball ("assert_fail.png")
which showcases the output of the two assertions failing
during simulation, which highlight this bug.

A second screenshot ("register_rst_visual.png")
showcases all of the delay registers of each delay
line being reset to 0 when rst is SystemReset_ is asserted.
This was verified through visual inspection of 
the waveforms.
